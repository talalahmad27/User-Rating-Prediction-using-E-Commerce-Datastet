# User Rating Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting user ratings
using structured data. The workflow emphasizes **data preprocessing**
and **model development**, ensuring clean and well-prepared data before
training predictive models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìå Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to build a predictive system
for user ratings. The process involved extensive **data preparation**,
**exploratory analysis**, and **model training**. While model evaluation
was performed, the emphasis of this repository is on the **pipeline and
methodology** rather than reporting specific results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning

-   Handled missing values and ensured consistency across features.
-   Standardized column names and data formats.
-   Removed duplicate and irrelevant entries.
-   Ensured categorical and numerical features were properly encoded.

### 2. Outlier Analysis

-   Identified unusual or extreme values using statistical and
    visualization techniques.
-   Evaluated the impact of outliers on model performance.
-   Applied appropriate treatments (e.g., removal, capping, or
    transformation).

### 3. Model Development

-   Implemented baseline machine learning models for prediction.
-   Performed feature engineering to capture patterns in the dataset.
-   Applied normalization and scaling techniques where necessary.
-   Structured the code for reproducibility and future experimentation.

## üìå Future Work

-   Expand feature engineering techniques.\
-   Explore advanced models (e.g., ensemble learning, deep learning).\
-   Perform hyperparameter optimization for better performance.
